pass your path in the variable TOOLCHAIN.
Executable and opk files can be named with TARGET variable. By default the name
is 'fuse_od'. Upstream version and build date will be added to opk name.
To compile for RetroFW pass 'retrofw' to DEVICE variable. For RetroFW opk
and ipk files will be created.

Examples:
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/retrofw2-toolchain TARGET=fceux_retrofw DEVICE=retrofw -f Makefile
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/opendingux-toolchain TARGET=fceux_od_beta -f Makefile
