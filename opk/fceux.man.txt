FCEUX 2.40 for OpenDingux/RetroFW
---------------------------------
Built on: RELEASE_DATE

FCEUX is a cross platform, NTSC and PAL Famicom/NES and Dendy emulator

This is a build for OpenDingux and RetroFW based on soarqin's 
fork with additions from gameblabla and pingflood's works and updated
to the upstream version 2.4.0 (Released 24 June 2021).

Bios file
---------
To load FDS files bios file `disksys.rom` is needed. It must be placed
at `$HOME/.fceux` directory or in the game directory.

Game Genie
----------
You must place Game Genie rom in the `$HOME/.fceux` directory and it must
be named `gg.rom`.

You can toggle it in `Settings Menu --> Main Setup` or with the
hotkey `R1 + DOWN`.

When toggled a hard reset will be done if a rom was loaded.

Auto-resume play
----------------
If enabled, FCEUX will make a special savestate every time you close
ROM (loading another rom or exiting from emulator), and will automatically
load the savestate when you open this ROM next time, so you can continue
from where you left the game.

This savestates will be created in the `$HOME/.fceux/fcs` directory and it
will be named `<filename's game>-resume.fcs`

What's new
----------

 In progress
  - Some refactorings for Game Genie use and assign hotkey to toggle it.
  - Added autoresume. It can be enabled in `Main settings`. This is a feature
    from upstream FCEUX.

 21 July 2021
  - The screenshot menu option now saves directly when the A button is pressed.
    Until now you had to press the A button and then exit from menu to emulator
    for the screenshot to be saved.
    Screenshots are saved at `$HOME/.fceux/snaps` directory. Filenames follow
    the scheme `<rom name>-<sequential number>.png`.
  - Fixed a bug in the automatic video region change that caused the save
    settings per game to not work.
  - RetroFW: Add Start+Select combo to open menu. Configurable in Control
    option. (taken from pingflood's RetroFW port).
  - RetroFW. Add ipk build for RetroFW 1 devices.
  - OpenDingux: For hardware scaling in OpenDingux 2014 versions (stock
    firmware or Rogue), the full screen is forced by disabling the aspect ratio
  - Add manual to opk/ipk and updated the Readme.

 10 July 2021
  - Based on soarqin's fork and upgraded to upstream FCEUX 2.4.0 version with
    additions from gameblabla and pingflood's versions.
  - Changes to Makefile for beta OD and RetroFW 2 compilation
  - Fixed the exit from main menu
  - Load rom: pagination with left and right cursors changed to scroll
    one page
  - For OpenDingux beta: Set video refresh rate based on cartridge region
    (taken from gameblabla's port)
  - Automatically set video mode based on cartridge region
  - Fixed the Flip disc option from main menu option
  - Enable Flip disc option in main menu only if a FDS file is inserted
    (taken from pingflood's RetroFW port)
  - Try to load disksys.rom from current rom directory
    (taken from pingflood's RetroFW port)
  - For debug purposes: when launch FCEUX witouth cartridge launch
    emulator rom selector
  - Change button layout in Control Setup
  - Some other minor changes

Build
-----
Use 'make' to compile. If your toolchain is not in /opt/gcw0-toolchain
pass your path in the variable TOOLCHAIN.
Executable and opk files can be named with TARGET variable. By default the name
is 'fuse_od'. Upstream version and build date will be added to opk name.
For 2014 OpenDingux (Stock firmware o Rogue) pass the variable ODVERSION=2014
To compile for RetroFW pass 'retrofw' to DEVICE variable. For RetroFW opk
and ipk files will be created.

Examples:
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/retrofw2-toolchain TARGET=fceux_retrofw DEVICE=retrofw -f Makefile
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/opendingux-toolchain TARGET=fceux_od_beta -f Makefile
make TOOLCHAIN=/opt/gcw0-toolchain TARGET=fceux_gcw0 ODVERSION=2014 -f Makefile

Build files are created in the `bin`directory.
